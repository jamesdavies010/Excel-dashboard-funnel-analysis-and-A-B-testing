### Description ###
An example of a funnel analysis of a fictional mobile gaming app showing customer conversion rates in each of the largest three markets.
I also ran A/B tests on New Year and Black Friday campaigns (included in the file).
My SQL codes for each task can be found in separate tabs on the spreadsheet.
